## Chrome Extension
### Load unpacked Chrome Extension
- To test the Chrome Extension while it's still in development, go to *chrome://extensions* in a Chromium-based browser and enable the Developer Mode in the top right
- Select the Load Unpacked button and choose the **extension** folder from this file structure
- For any code changes to the manfiest.json, a service worker, or content scripts, the extension simply needs to be reloaded by clicking the reload button on the extension
    - For ease of use, reloading after any code change is a good idea
